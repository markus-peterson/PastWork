This assignment was the first time I had to write in python, for which I had to teach myself because it was assumed we all knew python.

The server.py file starts a local server at port 8080, the send.py file sends a key value pair to the server for it to store and the retv.py 
	file sends a key to the server to retrieve the value associated with it. If the key sent by retv.py is saved on the server "ERROR" is returned.
	Lastly, driver.py is used to test all the other files. With the proper argument formatting it runs all other files with the specified arguments.

The .txt file in the code folder explains the command line inputs to run the programs and their functionality.
