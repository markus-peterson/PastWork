For the server.py file there is no specific arguments that change the running of the program.

For the alice.py program, the input arguments are the same as indicated in the instructions.
Example alice.py commands:
    python alice.py --key=username --value=foo
    python alice.py --key=username --value=foo --key=other --value=name


For multiple inputs to alice.py program the order of input does matter. This means for multiple inputs
    the command must have the pattern of --key=... --value=... --key=... --value=... etc.

For the bob.py program no such restrictions exist, but each key must be added with another --key=
Example bob.py commands:
    pyhton bob.py --key=username
    python bob.py --key=username --key=other

If bob.py tries to get the value for a key that does not exist, the server will return 'ERROR' as a string.

The driver.py can be run without arguments, but not much will happen as not data is being sent or is
    requested from the server.

Example driver.py commands:
    python driver.py SAVE=hello:bye,some:thing RETV=hello,some
    python driver.py SAVE=hello:bye,some:thing,username:other RETV=hello,some,other
