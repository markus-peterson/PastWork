The final project file contains a project three people from my class and I made. I wrote the majority of the Theater class 
and all of the movie class, but I can't take all the credit.

This was the first large project I worked on so it is not very efficient and there are a few issues with it. 
The main issue is how we saved the time. We only gave the progam the ability to save day of the week as a string and the hour in the day.
