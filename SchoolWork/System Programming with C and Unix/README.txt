For this course there is only the one program worth showing as the rest is about learning C starting with 
the basic syntax all the way to pointer and dynamic memory allocation.

I am including two folders, one before I started working on the program and the other is the final product.
This program is a rogue like simulator writen is C. The base of this program was written by Dmitrii Galantsev,
editted by Matthew Fulford, and the copyright is held by The Trustees of Indiana University and Indiana 
University Research and Technology Corporation.

This is just to show the additions I made to the basic program and express some of what I know about C.
